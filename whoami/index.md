### ❓ Introduction
I am a former cyberdefense student at ENSIBS and currently working as **Threat Researcher** for [Sekoia.io](https://blog.sekoia.io/). I previously worked as a **Threat Hunter** for [WithSecure](https://www2.withsecure.com/en/home), as part of WithSecure Countercept team. I am also part of the [x33fcon #crew](https://www.x33fcon.com/#!/index.md), helping the team organizing and running the event.

My favorite infosec fields are **OSINT**, **forensics** and **malware analysis**.

### 💻 Infosec, or about 80% of my life
Being passionate about computer security, I practice during my free time various activities in the field. Currently, I'm *heavily* focusing on malware analysis (Binary Ninja FTW 😎) and CTI.  

I'm one of the founder and a member of the [MILF](https://milfctf.com/) (*Mother I'd Like to Flag*) CTF Team, now sadly inactive. We used to participate in various CTFs throughout the year wether they are online or on-site. Now I just participate as a solo participant or with a couple of friends when I get the chance. If you're a member of an active CTF team looking for new members and reading that, feel free to hit me up!

Apart from CTF, I like to practice on various infosec learning platforms such as TryHackMe, HackTheBox and more recently [XINTRA Labs](https://www.xintra.org/simulations) (highly recommend 🥰) and [Malops.io](https://malops.io/). I also participate in cybersecurity conferences and events in Europe whenever I can.

### 🪟 Life outside of infosec, the last 20%
Outside of cybersecurity, I am also passionate about other things. I'm interested in motorsports as a whole. In fact, I often go ride by myself and sometimes participate in gatherings between fans of this discipline. I'll let you guess which model of motorbike I own... If you can guess it, beer is on me!

I'm also passionate about Japan. I had the opportunity to travel and work there for a few months in 2022 as part of my engineering degree. 

Music takes an important place in my life. I'm pretty open on the topic so I listen to a variety of genre, with a focus on techno however. So sometimes, I just take out my Maschine MK2 and create songs live.

Finally, space is a field in which I've always been fascinated by. That said, I wasn't that good in high school when it came to solving physics equations. :P

### ✨ Future plans
I plan to pursue either in the field of digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) and/or in CTI (with a huuuuge focus on malware analysis and research). My goal, as big as it may be, is to drive science forward, and more specifically the field of cyberdefense by contributing to the community and improve IT security.
