### ‚ùì Introduction
I am a former cyberdefense student at ENSIBS and currently working as **Threat Hunter** for **WithSecure**. My favorite infosec fields are **OSINT**, **pentest**, **forensics** and **malware analysis**.

### üíª Infosec, or about 80% of my life
Being passionate about computer security, I practice during my free time various activities in the field. Currently, I'm *heavily* learning and practicing malware analysis as I'm now the happy owner of a Binary Ninja licence üòé.  

I'm one of the founder and a member of the [MILF](https://milfctf.com/) (*Mother I'd Like to Flag*) CTF Team, now sadly inactive. We used to participate in various CTFs throughout the year wether they are online or on-site. Now I just participate as a solo participant. So if you're a member of an active CTF team looking for new members and reading that, feel free to hit me up!

Apart from CTF, I like to practice on various infosec learning platforms such as TryHackMe, HackTheBox and more recently XINTRA Labs (in love ü•∞) and Hextree.io. I also participate in cybersecurity conferences and events in Europe whenever I can.

A (short) list of books I've read and recommend:

### ü™ü Life outside of infosec, the last 20%
Outside of cybersecurity, I am also passionate about other things. I'm interested in motorsports as a whole. In fact, I often take part in rides or gatherings between fans of this discipline. I'll let you guess which model of motorbike I own... If you can guess it, beer is on me!

I'm also passionate about Japan. By the way, I had the opportunity to travel and work there for 2 months during summer 2022. Indeed, as part of the engineering degree, it is necessary to spend a minimum of **8 weeks** abroad.

Finally, space is a field in which I've always been fascinated by. That said, I wasn't that good in high school when it came to solving physics equations. :P

### ‚ú® Future plans
I plan to pursue either in the field of digital forensics and incident response or in CTI (with a huuuuge focus on malware analysis and research). My goal, as big as it may be, is to drive science forward, and more specifically the field of cyberdefense by contributing to the community and improve IT security.
