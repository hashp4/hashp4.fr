Projects I had the opportunity to realise during my whole scholarship at IUT d'Aubière (Network and Telecommunications), at the ENSIBS and during my apprenticeship at AlgoSecure.

### Cybersecurity, satellites and eavesdropping
<h4 style="font-style: italic;">(Sep. 2022 to Feb. 2023)</h4>

The project is a research project. At the end, the main objective is to help securing satellites communications. This project was divided in two main objectives :<br>
- vulnerability research on protocols used in satellite communications<br>
- setting up a satellite simulator to test our proof of concepts.<br>

Personally, I wanted to work on this project to discover the topic of cybersecurity applied into space in order to gain knowledge and to get out of my comfort zone. But also because space is a domain I find fascinating.
