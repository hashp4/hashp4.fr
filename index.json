The threat actor initiated the attack by first compromising the Azure account of an internal employee through bruteforce and MFA push fatigue attacks, gaining access to the VPN and being able to breach into a jumpbox server in Waifu University’s network as a pivot point from which to launch the attack. Phase 2: Lateral Movement (03/03/2024). The threat actor used several privilege escalations techniques and the Cobalt Strike platform to move laterally between the victim’s on-premises hosts and Azure environment through VPN and RDP connections. Phase 3: Data Exfiltration and Additional Lateral Movement (05/03/2024 - 07/03/2024). The threat actor managed to gain access to both the Domain Controller and the SQL server, allowing the exfiltration of a sensitive informations. Phase 4: Extortion Attempts (07/03/2024). The threat actor detonated their ransomware and probably threatened Waifu University to publish sensitive information if the ransom was not paid. They might have exaggerated about the volume and sensitivity of the stolen information.

Initial access via EntraIDThere was several failed login attempts on the identity provider of Waifu’s university, which is Microsoft EntraID (the new name for Microsoft Azure Active Directory). This is something we can notice by filtering for the azure.activitylogs.result_type field with the value of 50126. This “event ID” is related to Azure AD sign-in logs which capture informations about user sign-in activities within the Azure AD environment. In this case, the description displayed shows some kind of bruteforce activity. As the we can see on the timeline, those failed login attempts started on the 3rd of March 2024 at around 11:01:11 AM and finished at 11:54:58 AM. By adding the field azure.activitylogs.identity_name as a column, we can see the number of unique users that were targeted by the login attempts. The Field statistics tab show that the attacker attempted to authenticate with a total of 8 users. In the event details, we have some interesting informations such as the user agent used by the threat actor. Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/104.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 We also notice from which IP the threat actor was conducting his attack. It appears he used a cloud provider (AWS) to proxy his requests. Although the information was available in the event details, it is not a bad idea to double check on VirusTotal. That said, the information held in this event was limited and it’s hard to see if the threat actor managed to succesfully login. What can be done is temporary disabling the azure.activitylogs.result_type filter while adding the field azure.activitylogs.identity_name equal to exists to remove noisy events that are not related to this activity. Also, something useful is adding the field azure.activitylogs.resultDescription as a column to quickly notice a different behavior As you may see, for the same number of user, we have a few more events. By looking at the distinct descriptions, one that caught my eye: Strong Authentication is required. For me, it meant the primary authentication was successful (username:password couple), but that additional authentication was required (such as MFA). Adding this value as a filter is a good idea to see for which user those events occured. The only user concerned was Ignazio Vanderplas. Furthermore, we can see more interesting informations in the event details related to the user and the authentication. For example, the userPrincipalName (UPN) is available. Here, the value for the user is ivanderplas1@waifu.phd. Also, it appears the \"authenticationMethod\": \"Password\" succeeded, demonstrating the threat actor successfully logged into the account but was locked by the MFA. But he still managed to authenticate, even if MFA was setup. Indeed, he used a technique called MFA push fatigue. A multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue attack – also known as MFA Bombing or MFA Spamming – is a social engineering cyberattack strategy where attackers repeatedly push second-factor authentication requests to the target victim’s email, phone, or registered devices. The goal is to coerce the victim into confirming their identity via notification, thus authenticating the attackers attempt at entering their account or device. Source: BeyondTrust To find this information, increasing the timespan by 2 hours and filtering with the azure.activitylogs.identity_name of Ignazio Vanderplas is a great way. Then, same method as before, by looking at the distinct resultDescription messages to see if there was any interesting one. One was more present than the others: The message Authentication failed during strong authentication request is way more present than the others for this particular user. Having a look at the event details: It shows the MFA was denied by the user, meaning that each of this event sent a MFA push notification to the user.

Breaching the universityAfter knowing the threat actor successfully managed to connect to the VPN through the account ivanderplas1@waifu.phd, the next step was to find the breached host, which is the hostname the attacker was able to first access once in the network. Since the threat actor logged into OpenVPN, it is interesting to look for logins from the DMZ. Here are the filters that can be used to find the information: Windows Event Log ID 4624 corresponding to An account was succesfully logged on, the username of the breached account Ignazio Vanderplaswith the filter winlog.event_data.TargetUserName equal to ivanderplas1, the CC-VDG-01 host’s IP address (10.0.0.12) which is the Virtual Desktop Gateway. We can notice the first successfull connection was made at 13:37:32 PM the 3rd of March 2024 on the host called CC-JMP-01 corresponding to the jumpbox host. Another interesting information is the field winlog.event_data.WorkstationName which is related to the hostname of the threat actor’s device used to get into the network. After knowing the attacker accessed the CC-JMP-01 host, we investigated its dump. An interesting thing to look out for is the browser history which is located in C:\\Users\\ivanderplas1\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Default\\History We can see he searched for what is my ip. anf that’s pretty much it. But another interesting thing to look out for is which commands has been executed by the attacker. It’s worth investigating the Powershell command line history file located at C\\Users\\ivanderplas1\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadline The attacker downloaded SharpHound.exe as s.exe on the host directly from Github, in the following repo: https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection and executed it with the command .\\s.exe. Surely, this allowed him to enumerate the network in order to find privilege escalation and lateral movements vectors. Additionally, we can see that in Windows Event with an event.codeof 22 corresponding to DNS query. Here’s the proof that a Powershell process has been spawned to make a DNS query to github.com at 17:09:24 PM on the same day.

Privilege EscalationAfter thorough analysis, we were able to identify the threat actor was querying service information on the beachhead host about an hour after the previous event. Shortly after they seemed to have administrator access. At 17:53:50 PM, the attacker executed several commands for enumeration purposes in order to find a privilege escalation vector. wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode findstr /i \"auto\" findstr /i /v \"c:\\windows\\\\\" findstr /i /v \"\"\" Those commands are used to find Unquoted Service Paths. On the MITRE ATT\u0026CK website, we can find it is corresponding to the sub-technique “T1574.009 - Path Interception by Unquoted Path” which is commonly used for privilege escalation. By doing some research, we can find the exact same commands in this pentest cheatsheet on Github. A few minutes after, at 18:15:18 PM, the attacker created a file called waifu.exe (SHA1: dc202a87712c20412ab292fb0b868cff97b68db3 ). Then, one minute later at 18:16:21 PM, the threat actor started the service Waifu Service. The Waifu Service is directly linked to the waifu.exe binary created previously.

When we take a closer look at the command that has been executed, we can see that ScreenConnect will communicate with the host instance-i77ws2-relay.screenconnect.com The threat actor then ran an interesting payload. He replaced the legitimate C\\Program Files\\Python312\\python.exe with some kind of malware with the help of the ScreenConnect File Manager. As far as we know from the events we have, the binary was still legitimate on the 4th of March 2024 at 13:09:17 PM. The next day, 5th of March 2024 at 23:25:24 PM, the malicious python.exe was there. We confirmed that with the hash of python.exe that changed. Sadly, the sysmon event logs didn’t record any network activity due to the limitation of the configuration setup by Waifu University. Still, we managed to get the process dump from them for further analysis. By looking at the process dump, we find it was a Cobalt Strike beacon. By using the tool Cobalt Strike Configuration Extractor and Parser, we manage to extract the IP the beacon talks to. As you can see on the above, the hostname IP address is 207.246.70.192.

They did this in order to pull local password hashes. There are a few ways to dump Active Directory and local password hashes. Until recently, the techniques I had seen used to get the hashes either relied on injecting code in to LSASS or using the Volume Shadow Copy service to obtain copies of the files which contain the hashes.

Looking around the networkA few minutes later at 21:39:40 PM, the threat actor managed to open a file that was supposed to be in a hidden share from the beachhead host. We managed to saw that by filtering for event.code equal to 5140 corresponding to A network share object was accessed. Then checking unique distinct entries, we noticed the following share: SuperSecretSecureShare. At this point, we then just filtered for winlog.event_Data.ShareName equal to \\\\*\\SuperSecretSecureShare and added the field winlog.event_data.RelativeTargetName as a column to find any file accessed. The attacker first accessed the file you-cant-see-this-cause-I-am-good-at-NTFS-permissions.txt, still at 21:39:40 PM. This information could also be found in the output CSV file of the LECmd tool from Eric Zimmerman which is a LNK Explorer. Back to the Cobalt Strike beacon, we wanted to take a closer look at what has been initiated by it. To do so, a good option was to make an OR syntax filtering for C:\\Prgram Files\\Python321\\python.exe as a ProcessName or as an Image from the creation of the beacon. There was around 15 events found with this method. At 02:05:13 AM on the 6th of March 2024, the threat actor enumerated the Builtin\\Administrators group. Then, they managed to create the file SharpHound.exe at 02:18:41 AM. The same information could be found in the parsed $MFT with a little bit more of efforts. That said, they didn’t manage to execute this tool. Indeed, after filtering for event.code equal to 4688 to find created processes, there was no result for the SharpHound.exebinary.

Domain dominanceA few minutes later at 02:13:16 AM on the 6th of March 2024, the threat actor attempted to install a service called 8628f7b on the Domain Controller, linked to the 8628f7b.exe binary. Then at 02:22:02 AM and 02:22:51 AM, the attacker logged in with the account CC-Admin on the Domain Controller CC-DC-01. An interesting information we could find investigating those logs was the operating system distribution the threat actor is using: Parrot, a famous OS for security professionnals like Kali Linux. The information was found in 2 different events IDs : 4776 -\u003e The computer attempted to validate the credentials for an account 4624 -\u003e An account was successfully logged on. Around 30 minutes later at02:53:15 AM, the user CC-Admin ran the InjectDLL.exe binary from the AADInternals toolkit in order to inject the dll PTASpy.dllinto a process with a PID of 3616. Having the PID of the process injected into, we pivoted with that information to see which process had this PID before the injection. Something worth noting is we had to also filter for the hexadecimal equivalent of the PID (3616 in base 10 is equal to 0xe20 in base 16). It appeared the file name of that process was AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService.exe And it makes sense because while investigating for PTASpy, I stumbled across the PTASpy.ps1script on Github. By looking at it, we quickly noticed that PTASpy collects credentials and needs to be run on a computer with Azure AD Authentication Agent running, hence why it was injected in this process. Looking at the users present on CC-DC-01, we can assume that the credentials of the user cpecht7 could have get their credentials stolen by the DLL.

We had the information that the University admins noticed a strange file in the documents folder of the admin user for the SQL server which was created during the intrusion. So we started by searching for a suspicious file in the Documents folder of the CC-Admin user in the parsed $MFT CSV file and noticed a file called database.bak.rpt.kh1ftzx. To see the earliest MFT Entry of this file and track any change made to it, we then used the USNJrnl. So, we opened $J (a parse file) and noticed its first MFT Entry ID was at 03:09:24 AM on the 7th of March 2023.

It actually covers real analysis and will definitely teach you skills that will be useful in your daily job. After going through the lab, it almost feels like a senior threat hunter just taught me what he learnt and how we managed to investigate an AlphV/BlackCat incident response case. 🤓 I can tell a LOOOT of work was put into the creation of such a lab. I can only recommend it to anybody who is interested to the world of threat hunting or DFIR in general. It will be a great experience to actually practice on a real case scenario. And honestly, it’s really really cheap for the amount of education you will get. Kudos to Xintra for making it this affordable, especially in this industry where most of the educational content (especially for infosec certification) prices are getting higher and higher.

As a rule, ransomware operators don’t have just one victim. Each of them has a unique encryption key, and you need to be able to identify them to be able to decrypt the data if the ransom is paid. For this reason, a unique identifier is assigned to each victim and associated with the correct encryption key. However, this only applies if the attacker is willing to decrypt the data. There is absolutely no guarantee that he will keep his end of the bargain….

Use FLOSS and extract the strings from the main WannaCry binary. Are there any strings of interest?Using FLOSS, I extracted several interesting strings from the main WannaCry binary. First of all I noticed the following : C:\\%s\\qeriuwjhrf tasksche.exe http://www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com The first string is an absolute path to a file. At this point, I have no idea of what it could be but its name is composed of random letters probably to hide its real meaning and purpose. The second string is the name of an EXE file (tasksche.exe) similar to the official one for the Task Scheduler which is taskschd.exe 🤔. The third string is an URL to a strange website composed of random characters. It’s probably used later during the execution of the malware. Then, I noticed some more interesting strings associated to cryptography and command execution. CryptGenKey CryptDecrypt CryptEncrypt ... cmd.exe /c \"%s\" icacls . /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q attrib +h . WNcry@2o17 It looks like this malware is using cryptographic functions from the header wincrypt.h, probably to encrypt files. Also, I can see some system commands like cmd.exe /c or icacls related to file and directory access control lists. and attrib +h . which is setting the hidden file attribute. Additionnally, I noticed the string WNcry@2o17. I don’t know what is its purpose but from my perspective it looks like a password or something like that. I also noticed UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths.

But I’m really interested in how WannaCry is working and I want to explore deeper into this malware. So, this blog post will have a second part to add bonus explanation by answering more questions such as: What is the purpose of the other embedded binaries (Tor included 🤗)? How does WannaCry unpack its resources? How does the encryption mechanism works and takes place? Is it possible to decrypt the files even if we don’t pay the ransom? I hope you enjoyed this blog post and that it could help understand how WannaCry is acting. Do not hesitate to reach me out if you have any questions or if I made any mistakes in defining concepts or using technical terms. I’m still a newbie to this domain and I’d be happy to have feedbacks from more experienced analysts. 💜 PS: In a couple of days or weeks, I’ll probably start the exam and try to be PJMR (Practical Junior Malware Researcher) certified. In the meantime, I will train on different malware samples so I won’t be able to go back on WannaCry for some time. ^_~ Thanks for reading me and see you soon ! 👋 ","date":"2023-11-26","objectID":"/malware-analysis-wannacry-pt1/:7:0","series":null,"tags":["Malware","PMAT","WannaCry","Cutter","x64dbg","Procmon"],"title":"Malware Analysis : WannaCry (part 1)","uri":"/malware-analysis-wannacry-pt1/#conclusion"},{"categories":["Article"],"content":" Difficulty Start Date \u0026 Time Finish Date \u0026 Time Medium 15/11/2023 - 18h00 18/11/2023 - 21h00 ","date":"2023-11-21","objectID":"/malware-analysis-sikomode/:0:0","series":null,"tags":["Malware","PMAT","Cutter","x64dbg"],"title":"Malware Analysis : SikoMode","uri":"/malware-analysis-sikomode/#"},{"categories":["Article"],"content":" Instructions Analyst, This specimen came from a poor decision and a link that should not have been clicked on.

Then on the Dashboard tab, there is plenty of informations including the one I’m looking for. As you can see on the screenshot below, the malware has been written in Nim. As I wasn’t very sure about what Nim looked like, I searched some more informations on the Internet. Apparently, Nim was created to be a language as fast as C, as expressive as Python and as extensible as Lisp. Usually, malware authors use C or C++, Visual Basic and even Rust. Why bother using this language ? It’s because using a new programming language allow to bypass / avoid anti-malware protections. Indeed, at the beginning of its usage it wasn’t known from the AVs. Thus, there wasn’t any protections on hosts and it could run without being flagged. Fortunately, this is not the case anymore, to the extent that even legitimate Nim binary are being flagged, making it hard for developpers using this language as I read here: https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/9850. Also, when searching for the keyword Nim on Github, the third most popular repository is the OffensiveNim one. It shows that this language is pretty much used in offensive scenarios. It is also possible to know the language by analyzing the strings in the binary. Indeed, when using strings or FLOSS, I saw that a lot of them started by nim like nimMain, nimGetProcAddr and so on. 2) What is the architecture of this binary?To know what is the architecture of this binary, I opened it in PEStudio. As you can see on the screenshot below, it’s 64-bits. Cutter was also showing it in the Dashboard tab. 3) Under what conditions can you get the binary to delete itself?I noticed there was three different conditions under which the binary delete itself. Firstly, it will delete itself if the binary doesn’t have access to the internet and can’t contact the callback domain. WHat it does is send a TCP request on port 80 to the gateway. Then, there’s a DNS request to the domain update.ec12-4-109-278-3-ubuntu20-04.local. If it fails, i.e there’s no answers, it delete itself. I can confirm that supposition by inspecting the binary in Cutter. After displaying the graph of the sym.NimMainModule method, I noticed the following condition : On that screenshot, you can see the function checkKillSwitchURL being called. This is the one that will get the binary to send a request to the callback domain. Then there is the instruction test al, al followed by jne which is a conditional jump depending of the value of the ZF register. If it is equal to 0, meaning it returns true, it will continue its execution. Otherwise, it will delete itself by calling the houdini function (we will describe it later on, just assume this function is making the binary delete itself) If the internet connection gets interrupted, the binary will also delete itself. I noticed that by stopping INetSim during its execution. But there’s also a confirmation in the disassembled code in Cutter. This is the continuation of the previous screenshot. The checkKillSwitchURL returned true and the execution continues. Here you can see there’s again a test instruction followed by a jne instruction. This time, if the ZF regsiter is set to 0, it will call houdini and delete itself. Otherwise, it will continue its execution and call the unpackResources and stealStuff functions which is the normal execution of the binary. Thirdly, the binary will delete itself after its normal execution. Aswell as the two previous cases, I can verify that on Cutter : You can see that in both cases, the binary will call the houdini function, which means it’s bound to get rid of itself anyway. 4) Does the binary persist?

Indeed, when using strings or FLOSS, I saw that a lot of them started by nim like nimMain, nimGetProcAddr and so on. 2) What is the architecture of this binary?To know what is the architecture of this binary, I opened it in PEStudio. As you can see on the screenshot below, it’s 64-bits. Cutter was also showing it in the Dashboard tab. 3) Under what conditions can you get the binary to delete itself?I noticed there was three different conditions under which the binary delete itself. Firstly, it will delete itself if the binary doesn’t have access to the internet and can’t contact the callback domain. WHat it does is send a TCP request on port 80 to the gateway. Then, there’s a DNS request to the domain update.ec12-4-109-278-3-ubuntu20-04.local. If it fails, i.e there’s no answers, it delete itself. I can confirm that supposition by inspecting the binary in Cutter. After displaying the graph of the sym.NimMainModule method, I noticed the following condition : On that screenshot, you can see the function checkKillSwitchURL being called. This is the one that will get the binary to send a request to the callback domain. Then there is the instruction test al, al followed by jne which is a conditional jump depending of the value of the ZF register. If it is equal to 0, meaning it returns true, it will continue its execution. Otherwise, it will delete itself by calling the houdini function (we will describe it later on, just assume this function is making the binary delete itself) If the internet connection gets interrupted, the binary will also delete itself. I noticed that by stopping INetSim during its execution. But there’s also a confirmation in the disassembled code in Cutter. This is the continuation of the previous screenshot. The checkKillSwitchURL returned true and the execution continues. Here you can see there’s again a test instruction followed by a jne instruction. This time, if the ZF regsiter is set to 0, it will call houdini and delete itself. Otherwise, it will continue its execution and call the unpackResources and stealStuff functions which is the normal execution of the binary. Thirdly, the binary will delete itself after its normal execution. Aswell as the two previous cases, I can verify that on Cutter : You can see that in both cases, the binary will call the houdini function, which means it’s bound to get rid of itself anyway. 4) Does the binary persist?

Then on the Dashboard tab, there is plenty of informations including the one I’m looking for. As you can see on the screenshot below, the malware has been written in Nim. As I wasn’t very sure about what Nim looked like, I searched some more informations on the Internet. Apparently, Nim was created to be a language as fast as C, as expressive as Python and as extensible as Lisp. Usually, malware authors use C or C++, Visual Basic and even Rust. Why bother using this language ? It’s because using a new programming language allow to bypass / avoid anti-malware protections. Indeed, at the beginning of its usage it wasn’t known from the AVs. Thus, there wasn’t any protections on hosts and it could run without being flagged. Fortunately, this is not the case anymore, to the extent that even legitimate Nim binary are being flagged, making it hard for developpers using this language as I read here: https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/9850. Also, when searching for the keyword Nim on Github, the third most popular repository is the OffensiveNim one. It shows that this language is pretty much used in offensive scenarios. It is also possible to know the language by analyzing the strings in the binary. Indeed, when using strings or FLOSS, I saw that a lot of them started by nim like nimMain, nimGetProcAddr and so on. 2) What is the architecture of this binary?To know what is the architecture of this binary, I opened it in PEStudio. As you can see on the screenshot below, it’s 64-bits. Cutter was also showing it in the Dashboard tab. 3) Under what conditions can you get the binary to delete itself?I noticed there was three different conditions under which the binary delete itself. Firstly, it will delete itself if the binary doesn’t have access to the internet and can’t contact the callback domain. WHat it does is send a TCP request on port 80 to the gateway. Then, there’s a DNS request to the domain update.ec12-4-109-278-3-ubuntu20-04.local. If it fails, i.e there’s no answers, it delete itself. I can confirm that supposition by inspecting the binary in Cutter. After displaying the graph of the sym.NimMainModule method, I noticed the following condition : On that screenshot, you can see the function checkKillSwitchURL being called. This is the one that will get the binary to send a request to the callback domain. Then there is the instruction test al, al followed by jne which is a conditional jump depending of the value of the ZF register. If it is equal to 0, meaning it returns true, it will continue its execution. Otherwise, it will delete itself by calling the houdini function (we will describe it later on, just assume this function is making the binary delete itself) If the internet connection gets interrupted, the binary will also delete itself. I noticed that by stopping INetSim during its execution. But there’s also a confirmation in the disassembled code in Cutter. This is the continuation of the previous screenshot. The checkKillSwitchURL returned true and the execution continues. Here you can see there’s again a test instruction followed by a jne instruction. This time, if the ZF regsiter is set to 0, it will call houdini and delete itself. Otherwise, it will continue its execution and call the unpackResources and stealStuff functions which is the normal execution of the binary. Thirdly, the binary will delete itself after its normal execution.

As I said in the previous answer, the binary correspond to the legitime PuTTY binary with probably a backdoor in it. Thus, the inspection of the IAT doesn’t reveal anything interesting. However, from my perspective as a junior analyst, it’s quite appealing to import functions to add, delete and enumerate registry keys, even if in this case it’s legitimate.

As I said in the previous answer, the binary correspond to the legitime PuTTY binary with probably a backdoor in it. Thus, the inspection of the IAT doesn’t reveal anything interesting. However, from my perspective as a junior analyst, it’s quite appealing to import functions to add, delete and enumerate registry keys, even if in this case it’s legitimate. There is also functions like GetClipboardData and ShellExecuteA that are being imported. But those can also be legitimate for the regular usage of PuTTY. 6) Is it likely that this binary is packed?It doesn’t seem to be packed at first sight as I can read the IAT completely. But, I can verify it is not packed by comparing Virtual Size and Size of Raw Data of putty.exe. To do so, I have to open our binary in PEView. Then, by clicking on IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER .text, I can see the values I need. Size (in Hex) Size (in Dec) Virtual Size 00095F6D 614253 Size of Raw Data 00096000 614400 Size Difference 00000093 147 As I can see, the difference between the two is almost null. Since the size are almost equal, it means that thsi binary doesn’t seem to be packed.

During my test, I launched Wireshark and found an interesting DNS request to the following domain : bonus2.corporatebonusapplication.local. I can notice there is also some TCP RST packets. I don’t really know what to do with that information but I thought it would be great to keep it in case of. 2) From the host-based indicators perspective, what is the main payload that is initiated at detonation? What tool can you use to identify this?In order to get the main payload that is initiated at detonation, I decided to use ProcMon. First, I launched it and created two filters : Process Name contains putty.exe Details contains Command Then, I executed the malicious binary. As expected, I got some interesting results appearing. I noticed that Powershell was called with the PID 5820. I expanded the Detail section in order to get more informations about what is being executed.

A PowerShell profile is a script that runs when PowerShell is started to customize your environment. Since it’s not needed to execute a malicious payload, it’s better for an attacker to bypass it and avoid any scripts that could prevent its execution. -w hidden : Equivalent for -WindowStyle.

As a CTF player myself and a great fan of OSINT, my idea was to create a series of realistic challenges, something rarely seen in CTF. The aim was to immerse the player in a real investigation. The player quickly finds himself overwhelmed by a flow of information, and it’s up to him to sort it all out, in conjunction with the guiding statement. Several essential components were required to create these challenges: the theme and associated language (Japanese), the use of real actors, the use of real accounts. The series comprises 5 challenges combining several OSINT techniques: SOCMINT, GEOINT and physical investigation. The aim is to find and trace an attacker, a member of a Japanese criminal group whose objective is to meet a contact of his in France during the BreizhCTF. Throughout these challenges, the player is required to collect various pieces of evidence that will be useful in incriminating the man in question.

On the other, SOCMINT. 1. GEOINT PartFor this first part, we begin by analyzing Hijikata’s post containing a photo that appears to be the front of a religious building. We also note the presence of a banner on the wall. The description reads (roughly translated): Do you know where the small photo of the destination is? The event is just around the corner. He challenges his friends to find the location, knowing that the event he’s going to is right next door. By analyzing the photo despite its quality, we can easily extract the following text: Marcel Callo 1921 2021 A Google search of the text yields initial results indicating that the event took place in Rennes, and would be related to the diocese of that city. A closer look at this event reveals that most of it took place at the Basilica of Saint-Aubin. The next logical step is to search for this basilica on Google Maps to find out what it looks like and confirm or deny whether the photo matches. With the right placement on Street View, you’ll immediately notice the identical storefront. The banner still hangs there. This confirms that the event is taking place right next to this basilica, at ‘Place Saint-Anne’. If you haven’t yet made the connection with your current location (wink wink), an interesting search might be place saint anne events rennes The results quickly bring up Couvent des Jacobins in Rennes. As a final check, we can measure the distance between the two points to see if they are right next to each other. This concludes the GEOINT section. The target goes to the Couvent des Jacobins and will be present at the BreizhCTF. 2. SOCMINT PartNow that we know where the target is going, we can use this information. Here, the interesting information is the post in which he talks about his new car. He shows his wallpaper and we get a glimpse of some of the applications he uses. These include Blablacar. It’s an application for carpooling in Europe. Do you like my wallpaper? I bought a new car In addition, two other posts give us further information about his whereabouts. Firstly, one in which he says he can’t wait to see how they drive (implying foreigners) but also that he’ll be making a round trip from the venue to the station. As a car enthusiast, I can't wait to see how they drive. But it's going to be a short trip... It will be a round trip from the venue to the station On the other hand, he mentions in the second that he’ll be going home at the end of the event on Saturday morning. `In fact, I’ll be going home as soon as the event is over.
